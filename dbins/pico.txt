***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * sudo pico
      ^R^X
      reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
***** Limited SUID *****
If the binary has the SUID bit set, it may be abused to access the file system,
escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID
backdoor. If it is used to run commands (e.g., via system()-like invocations)
it only works on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default sh
shell to run with SUID privileges.
This example creates a local SUID copy of the binary and runs it to maintain
elevated privileges. To interact with an existing SUID binary skip the first
command and run the program using its original path.
    * The SPELL environment variable can be used in place of the -s option if
      the command line cannot be changed.
      sudo install -m =xs $(which pico) .

      ./pico -s /bin/sh
      /bin/sh
      ^T
