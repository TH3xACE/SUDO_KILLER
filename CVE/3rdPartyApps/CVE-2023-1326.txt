The apport-cli supports view a crash. These features invoke the default
pager, which is likely to be less, other functions may apply.

It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an
interactive system shell. If the binary is allowed to run as superuser
by sudo, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to
access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.

apport-cli should normally not be called with sudo or pkexec. In case it
is called via sudo or pkexec execute `sensible-pager` as the original
user to avoid privilege elevation.

Proof of concept:

```
$ sudo apport-cli -c /var/crash/xxx.crash
[...]
Please choose (S/E/V/K/I/C): v
!id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
!done  (press RETURN)
```

This fixes CVE-2023-1326.
